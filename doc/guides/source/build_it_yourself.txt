= Building on the Edge

The purpose of this guide is to help developers who want to work with the very latest code from Github. It covers how to:

* Get the latest copy of the source code from Github.
* Build and install the BrowserCMS product.
* Create a new project which uses BrowserCMS

If you want to get BrowserCMS the easy way, see link:getting_started.html[Getting Started] instead.

== Things you need first
Before you can build BrowserCMS locally, there are few other bits of software you should have installed.

1. *Git* - Distributed version control system. The code for BrowserCMS is on http://github.com/browsermedia/browsercms/[Git Hub], so you need to http://git-scm.com[get Git] to get it.
2. *Rails 2.3* (or later) - We make use of some of the newer features from Rails like templates.
3. *A Database* - Either Mysql or the Sqlite gems should be installed.
4. *Jeweler* - Another gem http://technicalpickles.github.com/jeweler[Jeweler] is required to build the gem yourself locally.

== Getting the source from GitHub
To build the gem from source, and install it on your system, type the following:

    git clone git://github.com/browsermedia/browsercms.git

== Installing the Gem locally
Once you have the source code, you can build and install the Gem via:

    cd browsercms
    rake install

On *unix, this will sudo install, so you will need to provide your password. Once you have the BrowserCMS Gem installed,
you can use it to create new projects, which will be configured to use it. At this point, you now have the gem installed,
so you can follow the instructions in link:getting_started.html[Getting Started] starting with section 2 (Trying out BrowserCMS).

== Quick Start
You can also just do the following to create a demo project.

    cd ~/projects
    rails my_new_project_name -d mysql -m http://github.com/browsermedia/browsercms/raw/master/templates/demo.rb
    cd my_new_project_name
    script/server
