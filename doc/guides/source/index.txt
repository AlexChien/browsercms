= BrowserCMS Reference Documenation

BrowserCMS is a general purpose, open source Web Content Management System (CMS), written in Ruby on Rails. It is designed to support three distinct groups of people:

1. Non-technical web editors who want a humane system to manage their site, without needing to understand what HTML or even Rails is.
2. Designers who want to create large and elegantly designed websites with no artificial constraints by the CMS.
3. Developers who want to add a CMS into their Rails projects, or create CMS driven websites for their clients.

This guide is for BrowserCMS v3.0.0 (Beta).
